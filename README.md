### AI-Powered Parkinson's Disease Prediction

ParkiSense is an advanced AI-powered application designed to assist in the early detection of Parkinson’s disease through **keystroke dynamics, voice analysis, and an AI chatbot**. Built using **Gradio**, **machine learning models**, and **Gemini AI**, ParkiSense provides an accessible tool for Parkinson’s awareness and analysis.
